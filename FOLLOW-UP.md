# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add? I would concentrate in making the webapp responsive plus accessible.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why? The frontend part as provided the create react app has restricted in many ways like using our own styling, importing public folder etc. The best achieve in minimum time was this. 

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult? The most time spend was due to creat react app in finding the rules why it has restricted the flexibility of styling, no webpack found, importing public folder. I wanted to serve the flights json using express, I have the file as it is but the server was not launching, don't know why. Thus I have to copy/paste the file. Ideal way was creating the server and using the file via axios but the srever was not launching at all.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them. I had lot of issues and problems as create react app has restricted us in many ways the express server was not launching to server json file, importing of puyblic folder was not allowed as it was outside src folder, using sass as I cxouldn't find plugins or loader usually we have webpack in place for the same, using mutliple classes in styling was troublesome as this is clearly no more somple process, had spent so much time investigating.
